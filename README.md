# Testing with Jest

A common practice in software development is test-driven development (TDD). TDD
follows a repetitive cycle of writing a test, then developing just enough code
to pass the test and then refactoring it to meet standards.

Jest is a popular testing framework for writing tests in JavaScript. This repo
contains some basic exercises for writing software tests using Jest.
